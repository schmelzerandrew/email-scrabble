# email-scrabble
An email based version of scrabble.


In one of my early attempts at OOP, I made this scrabble game.

It unpacks words and definitions from a text file, using double indexing to speed up search times.

It works much like the original game, including the letter distribution, the board multipliers, and the valid words.

The program operates off of a gmail account that regularly checks for incoming emails, processing them according to which game and which player they belong to. 

While the program worked fine, I never really used it: the way to specify the move you want was obtuse and difficult, which made the whole thing no fun.
